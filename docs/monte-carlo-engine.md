# Monte Carlo Simulation Engine

The Push Back Monte Carlo engine is the core component that enables fast, accurate strategic analysis through large-scale match simulation. It models realistic robot performance and Push Back-specific game mechanics to generate actionable insights.

## üéØ Overview

The Monte Carlo engine simulates thousands of Push Back matches using probabilistic models of robot performance, field conditions, and strategic decisions. This provides statistical insights into strategy effectiveness across varied scenarios.

### Key Capabilities

- **11,000+ simulations per second** with parallel processing
- **Realistic robot modeling** (cycle times, reliability, strategy preferences)
- **Push Back-specific mechanics** (88 blocks, control zones, parking strategies)
- **Statistical analysis** with confidence intervals and variance metrics
- **Scenario generation** for different competition situations

robot = RobotCapabilities(
    # Cycle Times (seconds)
    min_cycle_time=2.5,           # Fastest possible cycle

)
```

### Pre-configured Robot Types

```python
from vex_analysis.simulation import (
    create_default_robot,
    create_competitive_robot, 
    create_beginner_robot
)

# Standard robot with balanced capabilities
default = create_default_robot()
# Cycle: 5.0s avg, Reliability: 95%/98%, Parking: Late

# High-performance robot for competitive teams
competitive = create_competitive_robot()  
# Cycle: 4.2s avg, Reliability: 97%/99%, Parking: Late, Aggressive auto

# Entry-level robot for new teams
beginner = create_beginner_robot()
# Cycle: 8.0s avg, Reliability: 85%/90%, Parking: Early, Safe auto
```

## üéÆ Running Simulations

### Basic Simulation

```python
from vex_analysis.simulation import PushBackMonteCarloEngine

# Create robots
red_robot = create_competitive_robot()
blue_robot = create_default_robot()

# Initialize engine
engine = PushBackMonteCarloEngine(red_robot, blue_robot)

# Run simulation
results, execution_time = engine.run_simulation(1000)

print(f"Completed {len(results)} simulations in {execution_time:.3f}s")
print(f"Simulation rate: {len(results)/execution_time:.0f} sim/sec")
```

### Performance Optimization

```python
# Quick analysis (development/testing)
results, _ = engine.run_simulation(100, use_parallel=False)

# Standard analysis (strategy evaluation)  
results, _ = engine.run_simulation(1000, use_parallel=True)

# Comprehensive analysis (competition preparation)
results, _ = engine.run_simulation(5000, use_parallel=True)

# Real-time analysis (during matches)
results, _ = engine.run_simulation(500, use_parallel=True)
```

### Parallel Processing

The engine automatically uses parallel processing for large simulations:

```python
import time

# Compare sequential vs parallel execution
start_time = time.time()
results_seq, time_seq = engine.run_simulation(2000, use_parallel=False)
sequential_time = time.time() - start_time

start_time = time.time()  
results_par, time_par = engine.run_simulation(2000, use_parallel=True)
parallel_time = time.time() - start_time

speedup = sequential_time / parallel_time
print(f"Parallel speedup: {speedup:.1f}x faster")
```

## üìä Simulation Results

### Result Structure

```python
# Each simulation returns a SimulationResult object
result = results[0]

print(f"Winner: {result.winner}")                    # "red", "blue", or "tie"
print(f"Final Scores: {result.final_score_red}-{result.final_score_blue}")
print(f"Score Margin: {result.score_margin}")
print(f"Blocks Scored: R{result.blocks_scored_red} B{result.blocks_scored_blue}")
print(f"Autonomous Winner: {result.autonomous_winner}")
print(f"Parking: R{result.red_parked} B{result.blue_parked}")
print(f"Match Duration: {result.match_duration:.1f}s")

# Critical moments during the match
for moment in result.critical_moments:
    print(f"  {moment['time']:.1f}s: {moment['event']} ({moment['impact']} pts)")
```

### Statistical Analysis

```python
import statistics

# Extract data for analysis
red_scores = [r.final_score_red for r in results]
blue_scores = [r.final_score_blue for r in results]
margins = [r.score_margin for r in results]

# Calculate statistics
print(f"Red Alliance Statistics:")
print(f"  Average Score: {statistics.mean(red_scores):.1f}")
print(f"  Score Range: {min(red_scores)}-{max(red_scores)}")
print(f"  Standard Deviation: {statistics.stdev(red_scores):.1f}")

# Win rate analysis
red_wins = sum(1 for r in results if r.winner == "red")
win_rate = red_wins / len(results)
print(f"  Win Rate: {win_rate:.1%}")

# Close match analysis
close_matches = sum(1 for r in results if r.score_margin <= 10)
print(f"Close Matches (<10 point margin): {close_matches/len(results):.1%}")
```

print(f"Strategic Analysis:")
print(f"  Win Probability: {insights.win_probability:.1%}")
print(f"  Expected Score: {insights.average_score:.1f}")
print(f"  Score Consistency: {insights.score_variance:.0f} variance")

if insights.improvement_opportunities:
    print(f"\nImprovement Opportunities:")
    for improvement in insights.improvement_opportunities:
        print(f"  ‚Ä¢ {improvement}")
```

### Advanced Analysis

```python
# Competitive analysis against different opponents
from vex_analysis.simulation import PushBackInsightEngine

insight_engine = PushBackInsightEngine()

# Test against various opponent archetypes
opponent_results = {
    "speed_demon": results[:200],
    "consistency_king": results[200:400],

print(f"  Performance Consistency: {predictive_model.consistency_metrics['win_consistency']:.2f}")
```

## üé≤ Scenario Generation

### Standard Scenarios

```python
from vex_analysis.simulation import PushBackScenarioGenerator

generator = PushBackScenarioGenerator()

# Generate different match scenarios
scenarios = [
    "mirror_match",        # Similar skill teams
    "david_vs_goliath",   # Large skill gap
    "elimination_pressure", # High-pressure elimination
    "early_season",       # High variability
    "late_season"         # Refined strategies
]

for scenario_type in scenarios:
    red_robot, blue_robot, metadata = generator.generate_scenario(scenario_type)
    
    engine = PushBackMonteCarloEngine(red_robot, blue_robot)
    results, _ = engine.run_simulation(500)
    
    win_rate = sum(1 for r in results if r.winner == "red") / len(results)
    dynamics = metadata["expected_dynamics"]
    
    print(f"{scenario_type.replace('_', ' ').title()}:")

print(f"Custom Scenario Analysis:")
print(f"  Win Probability: {insights.win_probability:.1%}")
print(f"  Environmental Impact: {metadata['environmental_factors']}")
```

## üîß Performance Tuning

### Optimization Settings

```python
# Memory-efficient execution for large simulations
engine = PushBackMonteCarloEngine(red_robot, blue_robot)

# Optimize for speed vs accuracy trade-offs
results, _ = engine.run_simulation(
    num_simulations=10000,
    use_parallel=True,
    # Additional optimization parameters can be added here
)

# Monitor performance
import psutil
import os

process = psutil.Process(os.getpid())
memory_mb = process.memory_info().rss / 1024 / 1024
print(f"Memory usage: {memory_mb:.1f} MB")
```

### Benchmarking

```python
import time

def benchmark_simulation_sizes():
    """Test performance across different simulation sizes"""
    engine = PushBackMonteCarloEngine(create_competitive_robot(), create_default_robot())
    
    sizes = [100, 500, 1000, 2000, 5000]
    for size in sizes:
        start = time.time()
        results, execution_time = engine.run_simulation(size, use_parallel=True)
        total_time = time.time() - start
        
        rate = size / execution_time
        print(f"{size:4d} sims: {execution_time:.3f}s ({rate:5.0f} sim/sec)")

benchmark_simulation_sizes()
```

Expected output:
```
 100 sims: 0.009s (11235 sim/sec)
 500 sims: 0.043s (11628 sim/sec)
1000 sims: 0.089s (11236 sim/sec)
2000 sims: 0.171s (11696 sim/sec)
5000 sims: 0.434s (11521 sim/sec)
```

```

### Real-Time Match Strategy

```python
def analyze_match_situation(current_score_diff, time_remaining, our_robot, opponent_estimate):
    """Analyze current match situation for strategic decisions"""
    
    # Adjust robot based on current match state
    adjusted_robot = our_robot
    if time_remaining < 30:
        # Increase urgency, potentially lower reliability
        adjusted_robot.average_cycle_time *= 0.9
        adjusted_robot.pickup_reliability *= 0.95
    
    engine = PushBackMonteCarloEngine(adjusted_robot, opponent_estimate)
    results, _ = engine.run_simulation(500)  # Fast analysis
    
    insights = engine.generate_insights(results, "red")
    
    # Generate real-time recommendations
    if current_score_diff > 15:
        recommendation = "Consider parking early to secure lead"
    elif current_score_diff < -15:
        recommendation = "Focus on aggressive scoring, avoid parking"
    else:
        recommendation = "Execute planned strategy, park with 12-15s remaining"
    
    return {
        "win_probability": insights.win_probability,
        "recommendation": recommendation,
        "confidence": "High" if len(results) >= 500 else "Medium"
    }

# Example usage during match
situation = analyze_match_situation(
    current_score_diff=8,
    time_remaining=45,
    our_robot=my_robot,

## üöÄ Best Practices

### Simulation Size Guidelines

- **Development/Testing**: 100-500 simulations
- **Strategy Evaluation**: 1000-2000 simulations  
- **Competition Preparation**: 3000-5000 simulations
- **Research/Analysis**: 10000+ simulations

### Accuracy vs Speed Trade-offs

```python
# Fast but less precise (good for real-time)
quick_results, _ = engine.run_simulation(500, use_parallel=True)

# Balanced accuracy and speed (standard analysis)
standard_results, _ = engine.run_simulation(2000, use_parallel=True)

# High accuracy (competition preparation)
detailed_results, _ = engine.run_simulation(5000, use_parallel=True)
```

### Result Validation

```python
def validate_results(results):
    """Ensure simulation results are reasonable"""
    
    # Check basic validity
    assert all(r.winner in ["red", "blue", "tie"] for r in results)
    assert all(0 <= r.final_score_red <= 400 for r in results)
    assert all(0 <= r.final_score_blue <= 400 for r in results)
    
    # Check score reasonableness for Push Back
    red_scores = [r.final_score_red for r in results]
    avg_score = statistics.mean(red_scores)
    assert 30 <= avg_score <= 200, f"Average score {avg_score:.1f} seems unrealistic"
    
    # Check win rate isn't too extreme (unless expected)
    red_wins = sum(1 for r in results if r.winner == "red")
    win_rate = red_wins / len(results)
    if not (0.1 <= win_rate <= 0.9):
        print(f"Warning: Extreme win rate {win_rate:.1%} - check robot configurations")
    
    print(f"‚úÖ Results validated: {len(results)} simulations")

validate_results(results)
```

The Monte Carlo engine provides the foundation for all strategic analysis in the Push Back system, enabling teams to make data-driven decisions with confidence.
