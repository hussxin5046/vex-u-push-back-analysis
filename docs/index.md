## 🎮 Push Back Game Overview

The Push Back Analysis System is specifically designed for VEX U Push Back, featuring:

- **88 blocks** distributed across **4 goals** (2 center, 2 long)
- **2 control zones** with dynamic scoring (6-10 points based on block count)
- **Strategic parking** (8 points for 1 robot, 30 points for 2 robots)
- **Autonomous win bonus** (7 points for 15-second autonomous winner)
- **105-second matches** (15s autonomous + 90s driver control)

## 📊 System Capabilities

### Performance Benchmarks
- ✅ **11,000+ simulations/second** (Monte Carlo engine)
- ✅ **<5 second strategy analysis** (complete evaluation)
- ✅ **<500ms API responses** (real-time analysis)
- ✅ **1000+ scenarios in <10 seconds** (batch processing)

### Strategic Analysis
- **Block Flow Optimization** - Maximize scoring efficiency across goals
- **Autonomous Strategy Selection** - Risk/reward analysis with confidence intervals
- **Parking Decision Calculator** - Real-time break-even point analysis
- **Robot Design Advisor** - Performance trade-off recommendations
- **Match Adaptation Engine** - Dynamic strategy adjustments

### Technical Features
- **Realistic robot modeling** (3-8s cycle times, 90-98% reliability ranges)
- **Push Back-specific mechanics** (exact scoring rules and field layout)
- **Parallel processing** (multi-core simulation execution)
- **WebSocket real-time updates** (live strategy adjustments)
- **Comprehensive testing** (11/11 core tests passing)

## 🏁 Quick Start Examples

### Basic Analysis
```python
from vex_analysis.simulation import PushBackMonteCarloEngine, create_competitive_robot

# Create robots and run analysis
red_robot = create_competitive_robot()
blue_robot = create_competitive_robot()

engine = PushBackMonteCarloEngine(red_robot, blue_robot)
results, execution_time = engine.run_simulation(1000)

print(f"Win probability: {sum(1 for r in results if r.winner == 'red')/len(results):.1%}")
print(f"Execution time: {execution_time:.3f}s ({len(results)/execution_time:.0f} sim/sec)")
```

### Strategy Analysis
```python
from vex_analysis.analysis import PushBackStrategyAnalyzer

analyzer = PushBackStrategyAnalyzer()

# Analyze block allocation strategy
optimization = analyzer.analyze_block_flow_optimization(
    robot_capabilities={"scoring_rate": 0.5, "center_efficiency": 1.2},
    opponent_strength="competitive"
)

print(f"Recommended distribution: {optimization.recommended_distribution}")
print(f"Expected score: {optimization.expected_score:.1f}")
```

### API Integration
```javascript
// Frontend integration
const analysis = await fetch('/api/push-back/analyze', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    robot_capabilities: { cycle_time: 4.5, reliability: 0.95 },
    opponent_analysis: { strength: 'competitive' }
  })
});

const result = await analysis.json();
console.log(`Win probability: ${result.analysis.win_probability}`);
```

## 🎯 Use Cases
