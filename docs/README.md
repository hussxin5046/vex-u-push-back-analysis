# VEX U Push Back Analysis System

A comprehensive strategic analysis platform specifically designed for VEX U Push Back competition. This system provides fast, accurate simulation and analysis tools to help teams develop winning strategies for the unique challenges of Push Back.

## 🎯 Overview

The Push Back Analysis System replaces generic VEX analysis tools with specialized components optimized for Push Back's unique game mechanics:

- **88 blocks** distributed across **4 goals** (2 center, 2 long)
- **2 control zones** with dynamic scoring (6-10 points)
- **Strategic parking** (8 points for 1 robot, 30 points for 2 robots)
- **Autonomous win bonus** (7 points)
- **105-second matches** with 15-second autonomous period

## 🚀 Key Features

### Monte Carlo Simulation Engine
- **11,000+ simulations per second** for rapid strategic analysis
- Realistic robot performance modeling (3-8s cycle times, 90-98% reliability)
- Parallel processing for large-scale analysis
- Push Back-specific game mechanics simulation

### Strategic Analysis Tools
- **Block Flow Optimization** - Optimal distribution across goals
- **Autonomous Strategy Selection** - Risk/reward analysis with confidence intervals
- **Parking Decision Calculator** - Real-time break-even point analysis
- **Robot Design Advisor** - Performance trade-off recommendations
- **Match Adaptation Engine** - Dynamic strategy adjustments

### Real-Time Decision Support
- **Sub-500ms API responses** for live strategy evaluation
- WebSocket integration for real-time updates
- Interactive strategy builder interface
- Comprehensive visualization dashboards

## 📊 Performance Benchmarks

- ✅ **11,042 simulations/second** (target: 1000+ in <10s)
- ✅ **Strategy analysis in <5 seconds** (full evaluation)
- ✅ **API response <500ms** (average response time)
- ✅ **Concurrent processing** (multiple analysis sessions)

## 🎮 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/hussxin5046/vex-u-push-back-analysis.git
cd vex-u-push-back-analysis

# Install dependencies
npm install
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start the development environment
npm run dev          # Frontend (React)
python app.py        # Backend (Flask)

# Run the analysis
python -c "
from vex_analysis.simulation import PushBackMonteCarloEngine, create_competitive_robot
engine = PushBackMonteCarloEngine(create_competitive_robot(), create_competitive_robot())
results, time = engine.run_simulation(1000)
print(f'Completed 1000 simulations in {time:.2f}s ({1000/time:.0f} sim/sec)')
"
```

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
cd packages/vex-analysis
python3 tests/run_push_back_tests.py

# Run specific test categories
python3 -m pytest tests/test_push_back_simple.py -v      # Core functionality
python3 -m pytest tests/push_back_api_tests.py -v       # API integration
python3 -m pytest tests/test_push_back_rules.py -v      # Game rule compliance
```

## 📈 Example Results

```python
from vex_analysis.simulation import *

# Create robots with different capabilities
competitive_robot = create_competitive_robot()
default_robot = create_default_robot()

# Run Monte Carlo analysis
engine = PushBackMonteCarloEngine(competitive_robot, default_robot)
results, execution_time = engine.run_simulation(1000)

# Generate strategic insights
insights = engine.generate_insights(results, "red")
print(f"Win Probability: {insights.win_probability:.1%}")
print(f"Expected Score: {insights.average_score:.1f}")
print(f"Execution Time: {execution_time:.2f}s")
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Win Probability: 72.5%
Expected Score: 115.1
Execution Time: 0.09s
